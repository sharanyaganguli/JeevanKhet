    "para1":
    "Sustainable fertilizers are natural or low-impact nutrient sources that improve soil fertility without long-term damage. "
        "\nThey support soil microbes, increase organic matter, and maintain nutrient balance. "
        "\nExamples include compost, vermicompost, green manure, cow dung slurry, and bio-fertilizers like Rhizobium or Azospirillum. "
        "\nThese fertilizers release nutrients slowly and keep the soil productive year after year.",
    "image": "assets/dtfhj.png",
    "sub-title2": "Harm of chemical fertilizers",
    "para2":
    "Excessive use of chemical fertilizers such as urea or DAP increases soil acidity and reduces organic carbon. "
        "\nOver time, soil structure weakens, water retention drops, and beneficial microorganisms die. "
        "\nContinuous chemical use can cause nutrient imbalance, leading to lower yield and poor crop quality. "
        "\nIt can also contaminate nearby water bodies and increase production costs due to fertilizer dependence.",

        "\nUnregulated groundwater extraction lowers the water table, increases pumping costs, and can introduce harmful minerals like fluoride or arsenic into the soil. "
        "\nSurface runoff from over-irrigation also carries agrochemicals into rivers, harming aquatic biodiversity and contaminating drinking water sources. "
        "\nThese issues not only threaten farm profitability but also regional water security.",
    "sub-title3": "Advanced methods for sustainable water management",
    "point1":
    "1. Adopt precision irrigation: Use drip or sprinkler systems combined with timers or soil moisture sensors to deliver water based on crop demand.",

    "sub-title": "What is sustainable soil preparation?",
    "para1":
    "Sustainable soil preparation involves enhancing soil structure, fertility, and microbial life using methods that prevent degradation. "
        "\nIt focuses on conservation tillage, increasing organic matter, and promoting a healthy soil ecosystem. "
        "\nKey practices include reduced or no-till farming, cover cropping, and incorporating compost or manure. "
        "\nThese techniques minimize soil erosion, improve water retention, and build long-term soil health for sustained crop productivity.",
    "image": "assets/soilprep.png", // Make sure to add this image to your assets
    "sub-title2": "Risks of improper soil preparation",
    "para2":
    "Aggressive and repeated tilling pulverizes the soil, destroying its structure and leaving it vulnerable to wind and water erosion. "
        "\nThis leads to the loss of valuable topsoil and organic matter, reducing the soil's capacity to hold water and nutrients. "
        "\nOver time, a hardpan can develop below the tillage depth, restricting root growth and water infiltration. "
        "\nSuch degradation diminishes crop yields and increases the need for chemical inputs to compensate for lost fertility.",
    "sub-title3": "Effective methods for sustainable soil preparation",
    "point1":
    "1. Practice conservation tillage: Reduce plowing frequency and depth or adopt a no-till system to preserve soil structure and organic matter.",

    "2. Utilize cover crops: Plant non-cash crops like legumes or grasses during the off-season to prevent erosion, suppress weeds, and add nitrogen to the soil.",
    "point3":
    "3. Integrate organic amendments: Regularly apply compost, farmyard manure, or vermicompost to boost microbial activity and improve soil structure.",
    "point4":
    "4. Implement crop rotation: Alternate different crop families on the same land to disrupt pest cycles and balance nutrient extraction."

    "sub-title": "What are sustainable pesticides?",
    "para1":
    "Sustainable pesticides, often called biopesticides or organic pesticides, are derived from natural materials like plants, bacteria, and minerals. "
        "\nThey are designed to manage pests with minimal harm to the environment, non-target organisms, and human health. "
        "\nExamples include neem oil, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), and pyrethrins. "
        "\nThese alternatives are often biodegradable and work by targeting specific pests, thus preserving the population of beneficial insects like pollinators.",

    "sub-title2": "Dangers of synthetic chemical pesticides",
    "para2":
    "Conventional chemical pesticides can cause widespread environmental damage. They often lead to pest resistance, requiring stronger chemicals over time. "
        "\nTheir residues can contaminate soil, water, and food, posing health risks such as endocrine disruption and carcinogenicity. "
        "\nThese broad-spectrum chemicals kill beneficial insects, including predators of pests and essential pollinators, which disrupts the local ecosystem and can ultimately reduce crop yields.",
    "sub-title3": "How to implement sustainable pest management",
    "point1":
    "1. Adopt Integrated Pest Management (IPM): Use a combination of methods, including monitoring pest levels and using chemical pesticides only as a last resort.",

    "para1":
    "Sustainable management of excess crops involves utilizing surplus harvest to create value, reduce waste, and improve farm resilience. "
        "\nIt moves beyond simply selling fresh produce and explores value-addition, alternative markets, and on-farm recycling. "
        "\nMethods include food preservation (drying, pickling), creating processed goods, using surplus as animal feed, or converting it into green manure. "
        "\nThis circular approach turns potential losses into economic and environmental gains.",
    "image": "assets/cropusage.png", // Make sure to add this image to your assets
    "sub-title2": "The problem of post-harvest loss",
    "para2":
    "Post-harvest loss is a major challenge where a significant portion of the harvest spoils or is discarded before it reaches the consumer. "
        "\nThis is often due to a lack of storage facilities, market gluts that drive down prices, or aesthetic imperfections that make produce unsellable. "
        "\nThis waste represents a loss of income for the farmer and a waste of the natural resources—water, soil, and energy—used to grow the crop. "
        "\nDecomposing crop waste in landfills also produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas.",
    "sub-title3": "Strategies for using excess crops",
    "point1":
    "1. Food preservation and value addition: Dehydrate fruits and vegetables, create pickles, jams, or sauces, or mill grains into flour to extend shelf life and increase value.",
    "point2":
    "2. Diversify market channels: Sell directly to consumers at local markets, supply to food processors, or join a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program.",
    "point3":
    "3. Integrate with livestock: Use lower-grade or surplus crops as nutritious feed for cattle, poultry, or other farm animals, reducing feed costs.",
    "point4":
    "4. Reinvest in your soil: Compost unsold produce or use it as green manure by tilling it back into the field to enrich the soil with organic matter."
