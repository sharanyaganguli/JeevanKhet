"sub-title": "What are sustainable fertilizers?",
"para1": "Sustainable fertilizers are natural or low-impact nutrient sources that improve soil fertility without long-term damage. "
"\nThey support soil microbes, increase organic matter, and maintain nutrient balance. "
"\nExamples include compost, vermicompost, green manure, cow dung slurry, and bio-fertilizers like Rhizobium or Azospirillum. "
"\nThese fertilizers release nutrients slowly and keep the soil productive year after year.",

"sub-title2": "Harm of chemical fertilizers",
"para2": "Excessive use of chemical fertilizers such as urea or DAP increases soil acidity and reduces organic carbon. "
"\nOver time, soil structure weakens, water retention drops, and beneficial microorganisms die. "
"\nContinuous chemical use can cause nutrient imbalance, leading to lower yield and poor crop quality. "
"\nIt can also contaminate nearby water bodies and increase production costs due to fertilizer dependence.",

"sub-title3": "How to use and apply sustainble fertilizers?",
"point1": "1. Collect organic material: Gather crop residues, dry leaves, animal waste, and kitchen scraps.",
"point2": "2. Prepare compost pit or bin: Choose a shaded area. Dig a pit (1 m × 1 m × 1 m) or use a compost drum.",
"point3": "3. Layer properly: Add alternate layers of organic waste and soil. Sprinkle a small amount of cow dung slurry to boost microbial activity."
