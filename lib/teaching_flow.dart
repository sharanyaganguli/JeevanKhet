{"Sustainable Fertilizers":
  {
  "title": "All about Fertilizers!",
  "sub-title": "What are sustainable fertilizers?",
  "para1": "Sustainable fertilizers are natural or low-impact nutrient sources that improve soil fertility without long-term damage. "
      "\nThey support soil microbes, increase organic matter, and maintain nutrient balance. "
      "\nExamples include compost, vermicompost, green manure, cow dung slurry, and bio-fertilizers like Rhizobium or Azospirillum. "
      "\nThese fertilizers release nutrients slowly and keep the soil productive year after year.",
  "image": "assets/dtfhj.png",

  "sub-title2": "Harm of chemical fertilizers",
  "para2": "Excessive use of chemical fertilizers such as urea or DAP increases soil acidity and reduces organic carbon. "
      "\nOver time, soil structure weakens, water retention drops, and beneficial microorganisms die. "
      "\nContinuous chemical use can cause nutrient imbalance, leading to lower yield and poor crop quality. "
      "\nIt can also contaminate nearby water bodies and increase production costs due to fertilizer dependence.",

  "sub-title3": "How to use and apply sustainble fertilizers?",
  "point1": "1. Collect organic material: Gather crop residues, dry leaves, animal waste, and kitchen scraps.",
  "point2": "2. Prepare compost pit or bin: Choose a shaded area. Dig a pit (1 m × 1 m × 1 m) or use a compost drum.",
  "point3": "3. Layer properly: Add alternate layers of organic waste and soil. Sprinkle a small amount of cow dung slurry to boost microbial activity."

{"Sustainable Water Usage":
  {
"title": "All about Water Usage!",
"sub-title": "What is sustainable water usage in farming?",
"para1": "Sustainable water usage involves optimizing irrigation and soil moisture management to achieve maximum crop yield with minimal water waste. "
"\nIt emphasizes precision irrigation techniques, soil-water monitoring, and watershed-level planning to conserve resources. "
"\nPractices such as drip or sprinkler irrigation, use of soil moisture sensors, mulching, and rainwater harvesting enhance efficiency. "
"\nBy maintaining water balance and improving infiltration, farmers can ensure long-term agricultural productivity and climate resilience.",
"image": "assets/waterusage.png",

"sub-title2": "Impacts of unsustainable water management",
"para2": "Inefficient irrigation practices cause waterlogging, nutrient leaching, and soil salinity — reducing soil fertility over time. "
"\nUnregulated groundwater extraction lowers the water table, increases pumping costs, and can introduce harmful minerals like fluoride or arsenic into the soil. "
"\nSurface runoff from over-irrigation also carries agrochemicals into rivers, harming aquatic biodiversity and contaminating drinking water sources. "
"\nThese issues not only threaten farm profitability but also regional water security.",

"sub-title3": "Advanced methods for sustainable water management",
"point1": "1. Adopt precision irrigation: Use drip or sprinkler systems combined with timers or soil moisture sensors to deliver water based on crop demand.",
"point2": "2. Integrate rainwater harvesting and recharge structures: Construct contour bunds, percolation tanks, or check dams to capture runoff and replenish groundwater.",
"point3": "3. Improve soil health and water retention: Apply organic matter and biochar to enhance infiltration and reduce evaporation losses.",
"point4": "4. Use crop diversification and rotation: Grow drought-resistant or low-water-demand crops in dry seasons to maintain water balance."

{"Sustainable Seed Sowing":
    {
      "title": "All about Seed Sowing!",
      "sub-title": "What is sustainable seed sowing?",
      "para1": "Sustainable seed sowing focuses on using high-quality, climate-resilient seeds and precise sowing techniques to ensure healthy crop establishment with minimal resource use. "
          "\nIt integrates soil preparation, seed treatment, and optimized spacing to promote uniform germination and reduce input waste. "
          "\nTechniques such as direct seeding, zero tillage, and precision planting improve productivity while maintaining soil health. "
          "\nThese practices reduce dependency on chemicals, conserve water, and enhance long-term soil fertility.",
      "image": "assets/seedsowing.png",

      "sub-title2": "Problems with conventional or unsustainable sowing",
      "para2": "Traditional broadcasting or uneven manual sowing often causes irregular germination, overcrowding, and nutrient competition among plants. "
          "\nUsing untreated or low-quality seeds can lead to pest infestation and poor yield. "
          "\nDeep or shallow planting can affect root development and moisture uptake, especially under changing rainfall patterns. "
          "\nSuch inefficiencies increase seed wastage, require more fertilizers, and reduce overall soil and crop productivity.",

      "sub-title3": "Advanced methods for sustainable seed sowing",
      "point1": "1. Use certified and climate-adapted seeds: Choose varieties resistant to drought, pests, or local soil conditions to ensure resilience and consistent yield.",
      "point2": "2. Practice precision sowing: Employ seed drills, planters, or pneumatic seeders to maintain uniform depth and spacing, improving germination and nutrient access.",
      "point3": "3. Apply seed treatment: Use bio-fungicides, Rhizobium cultures, or Trichoderma before sowing to enhance root growth and disease resistance.",
      "point4": "4. Adopt conservation agriculture: Use minimum tillage or direct seeding to protect soil structure, retain moisture, and reduce fuel and labor costs."
